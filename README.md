Some tools to unpack and analyze for video game baldr_sky_divex.

Currently supports parsing
`.waz .mek .spm .grp .bin `
to json file.

Could generate the source file
`.waz .mek .spm .grp`
by the generated json file.

`.grp` parsing depends on the file name. Please make sure the file name is correct.
```
BatVoice.grp
MekaGroup.grp
SeGroup.grp
SpriteGroup.grp
Term.grp
WazaGroup.grp
```

`.mek` analyze is incomplete.
